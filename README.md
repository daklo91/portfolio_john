# portfolio_john

This is a very basic portfolio that I created from [a random design](https://www.figma.com/file/gKZoWoleFgP35xvYu83Y2l/Portfolio-UI---Web-%26-Mobile?node-id=0%3A1) I found on the internet. The design misses some links and consistencies in color which I added to my liking. 
Here is the website live: [John the technologist](https://john-the-technologist.netlify.app/#/)
The lorem is actual data, it can be changed in the store.js found in the assets/data folder. It is coded to be able to handle as many posts as you want.
If I were to make this website for someone, I would go for static generation using Nuxt.js instead of a SPA. This is better for SEO because the google crawler only have to crawl once.
